My parents always told me that I can be anything I want, so I decided to become an orange. To get that orange color, I got a spray tan. It was expensive, but it was worth it. Sometimes when I come home from school, I drop my stuff and go dig holes in my back yard. The hole is always large enough for me to stand in, so my head is level with the ground. I strip completely, and get in the hole. I then proceed to tape a head of lettuce to my head, to make it look like carrot leaves. I remain in the hole until sundown. This is the story of how I become a carrot every day.
